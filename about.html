          <p>My name is Nam Vu. It's so nice to meet you. Thank you for paying a visit to my page. I made this page to manage my professional 
            profile, and showcase my career objective, skill sets, portfolio, and experiences on my path in the Data Science field.</p>
          
          <p>I first studied Computer Science at HCM University of Technology, Vietnam for two years, before transferring to The University of Queensland, Australia. 
            In 2020, I graduated with a bachelor's degree from UQ, majoring in Data Science.</p>
          
          <p>As a data scientist, I work to develop software applications for data analytics production in business. With a strong background in 
            IT/Computer Science/Software Engineering, plus having a huge love for the Business aspect, I strive for improving user experiences through 
            deriving insights out of data, and delivering them (insights) to less technical colleagues and/or stakeholders to drive attentions and engagements.</p>
          
          <p>Previously, I worked for Zalo, VNG Vietnam as a data scientist. I was previously tasked to deliver insights based off of the user behavior analysis on zingmp3 
            platform, and deploy a tool for checking spelling and grammatical errors on texts.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted sk-text">I am quick on my feet. I love running. During my junior high and high school, I was always on the 
                    track and field team, and be selected as the top representatives to compete with other schools. My specialty on the 100-metre dash 
                    was top-class and I had proudly won many medals for the school. My best record was 13.78s at my 9th grade. Nowadays, I am not 
                    into competence as before, but I keep running as a routine to keep me fit and active.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted sk-text">I honestly don't think that I am a pro at billiards, but quite a skillful player I am. Billiards is one of 
                    my favorite activity since I first started learning to play it. I always enjoy every time I play with my friends, either for a chill-friendly 
                    match or a bit of competition. Billiards is an elegant sport that requires a combination of precision, cleverness, logical 
                    thinking of applying physics-mathematics, and also luck.</p>

                    pulled up the very first fish I catched. Till now, fishing is still one of the hobbies that I like the best. The satisfaction of catching a 
                    fish on your own is so great. I usually go fishing 2 or 3 times a year. Sometimes I fish at the rivers, other times at the 
                    indoor pools, but the best experience is fishing on a fishing boat at sea.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted sk-text">To me, video games are a part of me. Firmly to say that I can learn so many things from playing a game compared to 
                    reading a book or watching a movie. A good video game could provide me with a variety of materials for self-improvement. For example, I learn the rich 
                    and meaningful messages via storytellings of the game; I enrich my creativity and imagination through exploring the game world; I train critical 
                    thinking by solved puzzles or challenges; I meet new interesting game characters, that later I could develop companionship, love or hatred feelings 
                    toward; I cultivate a sense of gratitude to the hardwork of the developer team after finishing a game. I wouldn't mind talking all day about my love 
                    for video games, so let stop here...</p>

                    stopped half-way through after reading a few first pages. But to be frank, I really do enjoy reading recently, maybe because of the pandemic 
                    now that I have more time to open and finish a book then find the beauty inside of it. Reading also helps me realize how poor my 
                    writing is right now, and of course, it will get better soon, I strongly believe that. By the way, the genres that I like are 
                    mystery, crime and detective novel.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted">With high academic achievements, I entered junior high school and soon joined the top advanced class. 
                    This class representing the face of my pride school is full of 'beast' students excelling in both academic and physical activities. 
                    Joining this class is a challenge, but not being dropped out of this class after each year selection is the hardest one. No one 
                    would want to be the dropping-out ones, as we all set that as the ultimate goal, no exception for me. Besides that individual objective, 
                    the class united as one family either on the study, school competitions, moments of joys or sadness. In the end, I was proud to graduate as one of the elites.</p>

                    as of my junior high about staying in the tops. Rather, I put many thoughts and concerns dreaming of my future career path, what job 
                    I want to do or pursue, or what suits my abilities. I had juggled between professions of doctor, petroleum engineer for a year. 
                    Later, I even attended a drawing class for the architect's degree. And in the end, I chose to follow the IT profession as the final 
                    decision at my high school time. Why did I choose IT? Well, to put it bluntly it was for plenty of reasons...</p>

                    The universities then ranks their contestants, based on the total exam scores of all subjects, and chooses the top highest Ns to accept their admission. 
                    To be honest, this time period was quite challenging to most Vnese pupils but me. I passed the exam with a flying score and got admission to the top university in the country. 
                    It was quite 'easy'. Am I kidding? Maybe Yes, or No, of course, it was the fruits, built up by the very hard working and 
                    efforts in the past years I did.</p>

                    from university were not enough, and the image of succession I always imagined was completely torn apart since my first day of the internship. Simply put, I was brought back down to the earth

                    sexist career in the 21st century, Data Science'. At first, it was just a bit of 'all the fuss' curiosity about the career, and I started consuming 1 or 2 courses online, 
                    followed by taking the next 3, 4, or more courses. In addition, I bought some books to further my knowledge, then later worked on case-studies, side projects in data science. 
                    Unconsciously, I was totally in love with it.</p>

                    online sources, and my work-place seniors, doing my own projects, attending conferences, engaging in forums, finding new materials, reading new researches, practicing latest 
                    techniques, competing in hackathons / kaggle, writing blogs to showcase my work, etc. I believe hard work will eventually pay off in gold. Started off as an undergraduate dreaming 
                    to be a software engineer, then ended up as a graduate who is soon to be a full fledged data scientist. Up to this point, it had been a long and tough journey as it contained 
                    so many up and down moments along the way that I would not forget. While this memorable moment marked the end to my university life and the growth of me over the last 5 years, 
                    it has just marked the beginning of my career with the new journey ahead.</p>
